Shiny apps for teaching statistics

This repository will include code for several Shiny apps I've created in R to use in statistics courses. Links to access
those apps online are below (when applicable).


1. [Sampling method comparison](https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/riversampling/)
    - Description: This app is used to teach introductory statistics students about different methods of sampling. This is based on [this activity](http://inspire.stat.ucla.edu/unit_15/river.pdf). Students use simple random sampling and stratified sampling (by rows and by columns). When class results are compared, all three methods are equally good *on average*, but systematic sampling by column is by far the most consistent due to a pattern in the field. Students can type the word *census* at the bottom of the app to reveal the field's actual layout.

2. [Distributions of different samples](https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/samplehistograms/)
    - Description: This app allows students to see how samples of different sizes and from different populations will look as
histograms or Q-Q plots. For example, a sample from a normal distribution won't always look exactly normal.

3. [Treatment assigment method comparison](https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/fertilizer_experiment/)
    - Description: This app is used in our design of experiments course to carry out experiments based on different ways of assigning fertilizers to a 5 x 5 field.

4. [Effects of unequal sample sizes on confidence intervals](https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/effects_of_unequal_sample_sizes/)
    - Description: This app is used to illustrate how violations of the unequal variance assumption matter more in two independent sample confidence intervals when your sample sizes differ greatly

5. [Guessing a best-fit regression line](https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/line_of_best_fit_guessing/)
    - Description: This app is used in introductory statistics classes to have students guess which line "best fits" the data before showing them the least squares line and explaining how we find it.

6. [Coverage of multiple confidence intervals](https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/multiple_confidence_intervals/)
    - Description: This app is used to illustrate the need for a simultaneous confidence interval correction if looking at multiple confidence intervals.

7. [Central Limit Theorem simulation](https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/CLT-STS342/)
    - Description: This app isused in a statistics theory course to indicate how quickly the distribution of sample means will look normal for a handful of different distributions.
