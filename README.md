Shiny apps for teaching statistics

This repository will include code for several Shiny apps I've created in R to use in statistics courses. Links to access
those apps online are below (when applicable).


App: Sampling method comparison

Link: https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/samplingcorn/

Description: This app is used to teach introductory statistics students about different methods of sampling.



App: Distributions of different samples

Link: https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/samplehistograms/

Description: This app allows students to see how samples of different sizes and from different populations will look as
histograms or Q-Q plots. For example, a sample from a normal distribution won't always look exactly normal.



App: Treatment assigment method comparison

Link: https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/fertilizer_experiment/

Description: This app is used in our design of experiments course to carry out experiments based on different ways of 
assigning fertilizers to a 5 x 5 field.



App: Effects of unequal sample sizes on confidence intervals

Link: https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/effects_of_unequal_sample_sizes/

Description: This app is used to illustrate how violations of the unequal variance assumption matter more in two independent 
sample confidence intervals when your sample sizes differ greatly



App: Guessing a best-fit regression line

Link: https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/line_of_best_fit_guessing/

Description: This app is used in introductory statistics classes to have students guess which line "best fits" the data before 
showing them the least squares line and explaining how we find it.



App: Coverage of multiple confidence intervals

Link: https://vank-stats.shinyapps.io/multiple_confidence_intervals/

Description: This app is used to illustrate the need for a simultaneous confidence interval correction if looking at multiple 
confidence intervals.
